# Website Component - Link Tree

This HTML code creates a website component called a "Link Tree" with a modal that contains links to different websites. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

- **Button Trigger Modal:** A button with the label "Open linktree modal" and a share icon that opens the modal when clicked.

- **Modal:** A popup modal with a dark background that appears when the button is clicked. It includes a header with the title "Website Link" and a close button, along with a body that contains links to various websites.

- **Links:** Each link in the modal is styled as a list group item with an icon, website name, and description. The links open in a new tab when clicked.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - Bootstrap: For styling and responsiveness.
  - Bootstrap Icons: For adding icons to the links.
  - Custom CSS: Additional styles can be added using a custom stylesheet.

The modal provides a user-friendly way to display a list of important links or resources for users to access easily.
